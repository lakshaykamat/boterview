## Scheduling Questions

Questions are sent five times a day using cron jobs. Hereâ€™s the current schedule (24-hour format):

| ----- | ---------------- |
| 09:00 | Morning push     |
| 11:00 | Mid-morning      |

Make sure to call both `scheduleEmails()` and `scheduleTelegram()` from the main server file to enable this.
